# Colorbox Skins
Colorbox Skins is a small collection of UI treatments applied to the popular jQuery plugin, [Colorbox](http://jacklmoore.com/colorbox/), by Jack Moore.

## About the Plugin's Skins
The Colorbox plugin "ships" with a group of UI treatments, numbered Example 1 through 5 respectively, that demonstrate different ways to display the content that Colorbox presents. Additionally, the plugin offers a usage model where HTML markup is displayed - which means you can pretty much do whatever you like.

Still, some people want the ease of a theme (or skin) while needing a slightly different UI than the plugin offers. So here are a few...

## Example 5, Inverted
This simple skin repositions the main title bar used by the plugin in its included skin, Example 5.

### Question 10456680 on StackOverflow
Awhile back Nuri Akman posed a [question on SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10456680/moving-colorboxs-captions-to-top-of-box) about tweaking the position of Colorbox's main image line.  I posted an answer that was accepted and ended up writing code that was useful to the questioner.

That code was stored on another public file-sharing system and downloaded many times.

### Welcome Home
As of now, the so-called "Example 5 (Inverted)" is moved here, as part of this project.

### Files and Diff
There are no changes to the example's index.html file, and only minimal changes to the plugin's CSS file, colorbox.css.

A simple diff of the plugin's CSS file and this skin's is included for convenience. It's for reference, and not necessary to use this skin. Find it in the _addl_ folder.

Also in the _addl_ folder are two images that depict the impact of the CSS.

### Use and Testing
Install the CSS file from this project into the folder where you store Colorbox's original CSS file. Be sure to make a copy of the original file before doing so.
You are *on your own* as to testing in the browsers of interest to you.
